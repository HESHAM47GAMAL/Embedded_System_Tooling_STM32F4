## Description
<p>This course provided by Eng Ahmed Bahaa @ Seitechsolutions </p>
<p>I learn compilation process with different way as what is output from each phase of compilation process  </p>
<p>I implement LinkerScript and Startup code for stm32f4 </p>
<p>as make compilation process for each file By own self is difficult so learn Makefile to make it easier </p>
<p>Then want to make it more easier as when only click on file make everything and generate Hex file from one press using Batch file</p>
